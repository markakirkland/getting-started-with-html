<h1> <em>Important Concepts</em> </h1>
<b> Components of the Web </b>
<p> The evolution of the web has been underpinned by some fundamental components.  A birds-eye view of these components are a client, a server, a means of travel, and a vehicle in which to travel.  In other words, you have a computer that is requesting information, a computer that is hosting information, a network that connects them, and protocol that helps each side understand and be understood.  Here is a a fun depiction of of what I just explained:<br> <img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~maa1/avenidas/internet_class/session_1/how_the_web_works_1/www2.gif" alt="How the web works">  </p>

<p> The key to understanding is connecting the information.  If you think of it in terms of a city it may make the ideas and concepts more concrete.  For example, there are may homes in a city.  Each home must supply food to its occupants.  In the most traditional sense, the occupants go to the grocery store via a roadway.  On the road and in the store there are rules that must be followed.  Ultimately, the food is brought back to the residence and everyone is happy.  In essence, the people in this example are the packets seeking to establish a connection.  The store is the server.  And, the food is the data brought back to the requesting home.  Make sense?</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p> HTML is the Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is made up of elements that consist of many different tags.  Tags work together to make the information being presented, more intelligible. We do this in writing all of the time.  For example, when you create a title for a story you are writing, you don't put it at the end of the story!?  You put it in the beginning.  Also, if you have chapters, you would want to make a clear distinction of when one ends and another begins.  Well, HTML helps represent this concepts electronically... only a computer needs HTML (on a web page) to present information in a way humans can do with a pen.  The most obvious example is this page you are reading!  Imagine if all of the paragraphs were connected with no spacing, no bold text, and all the same size font.  Ugh! <b>:o(</b>  So, HTML can be thought of as the the rules to written communication... there</p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>Unlike human writing, HTML utilzes elements that are comprised of tags.  These tags enable things like linking to other references.  In a book, one would have to go to the bibliography to find a source.  But, with HTML you can embed a source... making it only a click away!  Here, see what Wikipedia has to say about <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element"> Tags and Elements!</a> <--- Isn't that cool?' This is just one of many.  Even making text bold utilizes a tag... not as cool, but, definitely helpful.</p>
<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<p>The distinction between inline and block elements comes mainly in how they make HTML behave.  Block elements create an invisible box around the content inside of them. W3schools explain it like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp"> this.</a>
